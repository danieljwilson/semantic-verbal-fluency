Sometimes we grasp things easily and develop our own way of doing and sometimes we simply copy. Educating someone does not mean attaining textual knowledge. It is also responsible for your overall development. There are various activities shown in your science book, they are from our day to day activities and you should try them because when you perform such activities, your mind automatically generates various questions and this leads to a searching tendency.`;
